    <h1 class="c">Heading 1 (center)</h1>
    <h2 class="l">Heading 2 (left)</h2>
    <h3 class="r">Heading 3 (right)</h3>
    <p>The three headings above are aligned center, left and right.</p>
    <hr><br>

    <h1>Example text-align: justify</h1>
    <p>The text-align: justify; value stretches the lines so that each line has equal width (like in newspapers and magazines).</p>
