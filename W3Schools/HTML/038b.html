        <h2>HTML &lt;aside&gt; Element</h2>
        <p>
            The &lt;aside&gt; element defines some content aside from the content it is placed
            in (like a sidebar).
        </p>
        <p>
            The &lt;aside&gt; content should be indirectly related to the surrounding content.
        </p>

        <p>
            The &lt;figure&gt; tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations,
            diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.

        <h2>Why Semantic Elements</h2>
        <p>
            According to the W3C: "A semantic Web allows data to be shared and reused across
            applications, enterprises, and communities."
